# Week1-code-refactor

# Overview of Project (Horiseon)

The brief for this project was to refactor the existing code to ensure it meets **accessibility** requirements to allow people with disabilities
to access the website using assistive technology. 

The changes implemented include addition of semantics HTML elements, HTML structure to follow logical order, accessible alt attributes for images,
heading attributes follow a sequential order and title element updated to provide a concise description of the site. Comments were also added to html and 
css file for other developers to see the logic behind the changes and to allow easier readability.

Website was checked for accessibility using [**online tool**](https://www.deque.com/free-accessibility-test/) and colour constrast was found to be inadequate 
by accessibility standards. Colours were then changed to darker base colours like blue to enable more constrast between text and background. After updating 
the colour deficiencies the site received the following result "Good news! This page passed 23 of our checks. We also found zero critical or serious problems!"
